This core function is\n        called by several dimension-specific implementation functions.\n        \n        Arguments:\n            data:       an object array, generator, or function that returns a list-like\n        \n            key:        field for the Series index\n        \n            value:      field for the Series column values\n        \n            name:       Series column name. If None, same as value\n        \n        Returns:\n            a pandas Series object\n        \n        Example:\n            Generally you are better off calling the Series function for a specific feature\n            e.g., wbgapi.time.Series(). Direct calls should only be necessary for databases\n            with custom dimensions, for instance:\n        \n            wbgapi.Series(wbgapi.source.features('version', db=57))\n    \n    abbreviate(text, q=None, padding=80)\n        Returns a shortened version of the text string comprised of the search pattern\n        and a specified number of characters on either side. This is used to optimize\n        search results. If the search pattern\n    \n    fetch(url, params={}, concepts=False, lang=None)\n        Iterate over an API request with automatic paging.  The API returns a\n        variety of response structures depending on the endpoint. fetch() sniffs\n        the response structure and return the most appropriate set of iterated objects.\n        \n        Arguments:\n            url:        partial URL (minus the base URL and langage) for the API query, minus the query string\n        \n            params:     optional query string parameters (required defaults are supplied by the function)\n        \n            concepts:   pass True to return results at the concept level, as opposed to the element/variable level\n        \n            lang:       preferred language. Pass none to use the global default\n        \n        Returns:\n            a generator object.\n        \n        Example:\n            for row in wbgapi.data.fetch('countries'):\n              print(row['id'], row['name'])\n        \n        Notes:\n            For most use cases there are higher level functions that are easier and safer than\n            calling fetch() directly. But it's still very useful for direct testing and discovery\n            of the API.\n    \n    get(url, params={}, concepts=False, lang=None)\n        Return a single response from the API\n        \n        Arguments:\n            url:        full URL for the API query, minus the query string\n        \n            params:     optional query string parameters (required defaults are supplied by the function)\n        \n            concepts:   pass True to return a result at the concept level, as opposed to the element/variable level\n        \n        Returns:\n            First row from the response\n        \n        Example:\n            print(wbgapi.get('countries/BRA')['name'])\n    \n    htmlTable(*args, **kwargs)\n        Generates an HTML table wrapped in a <div class=\"wbgapi\"/> to allow users\n        to customize the display if they wish. All arguments are passed to tabulate;\n        you should not include the 'tablefmt=html' parameter\n    \n    metadata(url, variables, concepts='all', **kwargs)\n        Return metadata records\n        \n        Arguments:\n            url:        url with tokens, as per refetch()\n        \n            variables:  variables that can be chunked, in priority order (see refetch)\n        \n            concepts:   Name or list-like of the concepts to return: 'all' for all concepts\n        \n            **kwargs:   Remaining arguments to pass to refetch (must include varables for tokens in url)\n        \n        Returns:\n            a generator that returns Metadata objects\n        \n        Example:\n            for meta in wbgapi.metadata('sources/2/series/{series}/country/{economy}/metadata', ['series', 'economy'],\n                concepts=['Series','Country-Series'], series='SP.POP.TOTL', economy='FRA;CAN'):\n                    print(meta.concept, meta.id, len(meta.metadata))\n                    \n        Notes:\n            Each return from the generator will include a unique concept/id pair and a complete corresponding metadata record\n    \n    queryParam(arg, concept=None, db=None)\n        Prepare parameters for an API query. This is a core function\n        called by several dimension-specific functions of the same name\n        \n        Arguments:\n            arg:        a record identifier or list-like of identifiers\n        \n            concept:    concept for the arguments passed\n        \n            db:         database; pass None to access the global database\n        \n        Returns:\n            a semicolon separated API-ready parameter string\n    \n    reduce(...)\n        reduce(function, sequence[, initial]) -> value\n        \n        Apply a function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of a sequence,\n        from left to right, so as to reduce the sequence to a single value.\n        For example, reduce(lambda x, y: x+y, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) calculates\n        ((((1+2)+3)+4)+5).  If initial is present, it is placed before the items\n        of the sequence in the calculation, and serves as a default when the\n        sequence is empty.\n    \n    refetch(url, variables, **kwargs)\n        repeating fetch: provides a variation of fetch() that allows URLs that exceed the maximium API limit to\n        be chunked.\n        \n        Arguments:\n            url:            partial URL with tokens, each of which must have values specified as function arguments. See example below\n        \n            variables:      array of variables to be chunked if necessary, in the order they should be chunked\n        \n            **kwargs:       remaining arguments MUST include values for each token in the url string. All arguments to fetch\n                            are also acceptable and are passed to fetch. Any \"chunkable\" variable should be a semicolon-separated\n                            value array. Arrays and iterables are not acceptable values\n        \n        Returns:\n            A generator object\n        \n        Example:\n            # fetch all indicators for Brazil and Argentina\n            s = ';'.join([row['id'] for row in wbgapi.series.list()])\n            for row in wbgapi.data.refetch('sources/{source}/series/{series}/country/{economy}', ['series', 'economy'], source=2, series=s, economy='BRA;ARG'):\n                print(row)\n    \n    search(q, footnotes='none', brief=False, padding=80, db=None)\n        search database metadata and return results as a print-friendly object\n        \n        Arguments:\n            q:          search term\n        \n            footnotes:  how to treat footnotes: 'include', 'only', or 'none'\n        \n            brief:      abbreviated output (don't print matching values)\n        \n            padding:    approximate number of surrounding characters to include when displaying text matching\n                        the search term. None returns the entire string\n        \n            db:         database; pass None to access the global database\n        \n        Returns:\n            a print-friendly object\n        \n        Notes:\n            This function just provides a print-friendly front end to search2. If you need to\n            access search results programmatically, call search2 directly.\n        \n        Examples:\n            wbgapi.search('fossil fuels')\n    \n    search2(q, footnotes='none', db=None)\n        search database metadata for matching text, returning a generator\n        \n        Arguments:\n            q:          search term\n        \n            footnotes:  how to treat footnotes: 'include', 'only', or 'none'\n        \n            db:         database; pass None to access the global database\n        \n        Returns:\n            a generator that provides Metadata objects (same as metadata())\n        \n        Notes:\n            The return of this function is the same as for the metadata() function. The difference\n            is that the metadata property contains matching metadata fields and values.\n        \n        Examples:\n            for row in wbgapi.search2('fossil fuels'):\n                print(row)\n\nDATA\n    api_maxlen = 1400\n    db = 2\n    endpoint = 'https://api.worldbank.org/v2'\n    lang = 'en'\n    per_page = 1000\n    proxies = None\n\nVERSION\n    1.0.5\n\nFILE\n    /root/venv/lib/python3.7/site-packages/wbgapi/__init__.py\n\n\n",
